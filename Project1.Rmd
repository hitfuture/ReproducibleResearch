###Loading and preprocessing the data



```{r read.data, echo=TRUE}
activities<-read.csv("./data/activity.csv")
```

###What is mean total number of steps taken per day?   
Total steps taken `r sum(activities$steps[!is.na(activities$steps)])`
```{r mean.steps, echo=TRUE,results='asis',message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(xtable)

by.day<-activities%>%group_by(date)%>%summarize(total.steps=sum(steps))
print(xtable(by.day))
```

```{r plot.overview, echo=TRUE,results='asis'}
plot(activities)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
